        <h1>factory_girl</h1>
<p>
factory_girl is a fixtures replacement with a straightforward definition
syntax, support for multiple build strategies (saved instances, unsaved
instances, attribute hashes, and stubbed objects), and support for multiple
factories for the same class (user, admin_user, and so on), including
factory inheritance.

<h2>Download</h2>
<p>
Github: <a
href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/tree/master">github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/tree/master</a>
</p>
<p>
Gem:
</p>
<pre>
  gem install thoughtbot-factory_girl --source http://gems.github.com
</pre>
<p>
Note: if you install factory_girl using the gem from Github, you&#8217;ll
need this in your environment.rb if you want to use Rails 2.1+&#8217;s
dependency manager:
</p>
<pre>
  config.gem &quot;thoughtbot-factory_girl&quot;,
             :lib    =&gt; &quot;factory_girl&quot;,
             :source =&gt; &quot;http://gems.github.com&quot;
</pre>
<h2>Defining factories</h2>
<p>
Each factory has a name and a set of attributes. The name is used to guess
the class of the object by default, but it&#8217;s possible to explicitly
specify it:
</p>
<pre>
  # This will guess the User class
  Factory.define :user do |u|
    u.first_name 'John'
    u.last_name  'Doe'
    u.admin false
  end

  # This will use the User class (Admin would have been guessed)
  Factory.define :admin, :class =&gt; User do |u|
    u.first_name 'Admin'
    u.last_name  'User'
    u.admin true
  end

  # The same, but using a string instead of class constant
  Factory.define :admin, :class =&gt; 'user' do |u|
    u.first_name 'Admin'
    u.last_name  'User'
    u.admin true
  end
</pre>
<p>
It is highly recommended that you have one factory for each class that
provides the simplest set of attributes necessary to create an instance of
that class. If you&#8217;re creating ActiveRecord objects, that means that
you should only provide attributes that are required through validations
and that do not have defaults. <a href="../classes/Other.html">Other</a>
factories can be created through inheritance to cover common scenarios for
each class.
</p>
<p>
Factories can either be defined anywhere, but will automatically be loaded
if they are defined in files at the following locations:
</p>
<pre>
  test/factories.rb
  spec/factories.rb
  test/factories/*.rb
  spec/factories/*.rb
</pre>
<h2>Using factories</h2>
<p>
factory_girl supports several different build strategies: build, create,
attributes_for and stub:
</p>
<pre>
  # Returns a User instance that's not saved
  user = Factory.build(:user)

  # Returns a saved User instance
  user = Factory.create(:user)

  # Returns a hash of attributes that can be used to build a User instance:
  attrs = Factory.attributes_for(:user)

  # Returns an object with all defined attributes stubbed out:
  stub = Factory.stub(:user)
</pre>
<p>
You can use the <a href="../classes/Factory.html">Factory</a> method as a
shortcut for the default build strategy:
</p>
<pre>
  # Same as Factory.create :user:
  user = Factory(:user)
</pre>
<p>
The default strategy can be overriden:
</p>
<pre>
  # Now same as Factory.build(:user)
  Factory.define :user, :default_strategy =&gt; :build do |u|
    ...
  end

  user = Factory(:user)
</pre>
<p>
No matter which startegy is used, it&#8217;s possible to override the
defined attributes by passing a hash:
</p>
<pre>
  # Build a User instance and override the first_name property
  user = Factory.build(:user, :first_name =&gt; 'Joe')
  user.first_name
  # =&gt; &quot;Joe&quot;
</pre>
<h2>Lazy Attributes</h2>
<p>
Most factory attributes can be added using static values that are evaluated
when the factory is defined, but some attributes (such as associations and
other attributes that must be dynamically generated) will need values
assigned each time an instance is generated. These &#8220;lazy&#8221;
attributes can be added by passing a block instead of a parameter:
</p>
<pre>
  Factory.define :user do |u|
    # ...
    u.activation_code { User.generate_activation_code }
  end
</pre>
<h2>Dependent Attributes</h2>
<p>
Attributes can be based on the values of other attributes using the proxy
that is yieled to lazy attribute blocks:
</p>
<pre>
  Factory.define :user do |u|
    u.first_name 'Joe'
    u.last_name  'Blow'
    u.email {|a| &quot;#{a.first_name}.#{a.last_name}@example.com&quot;.downcase }
  end

  Factory(:user, :last_name =&gt; 'Doe').email
  # =&gt; &quot;joe.doe@example.com&quot;
</pre>
<h2>Associations</h2>
<p>
Associated instances can be generated by using the association method when
defining a lazy attribute:
</p>
<pre>
  Factory.define :post do |p|
    # ...
    p.author {|author| author.association(:user, :last_name =&gt; 'Writely') }
  end
</pre>
<p>
The behavior of the association method varies depending on the build
strategy used for the parent object.
</p>
<pre>
  # Builds and saves a User and a Post
  post = Factory(:post)
  post.new_record?       # =&gt; false
  post.author.new_record # =&gt; false

  # Builds and saves a User, and then builds but does not save a Post
  Factory.build(:post)
  post.new_record?       # =&gt; true
  post.author.new_record # =&gt; false
</pre>
<p>
Because this pattern is so common, a prettier syntax is available for
defining associations:
</p>
<pre>
  # The following definitions are equivilent:
  Factory.define :post do |p|
    p.author {|a| a.association(:user) }
  end

  Factory.define :post do |p|
    p.association :author, :factory =&gt; :user
  end
</pre>
<p>
If the factory name is the same as the association name, the factory name
can be left out.
</p>
<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p>
You can easily create multiple factories for the same class without
repeating common attributes by using inheritance:
</p>
<pre>
  Factory.define :post do |p|
    # the 'title' attribute is required for all posts
    p.title 'A title'
  end

  Factory.define :approved_post, :parent =&gt; :post do |p|
    p.approved true
    # the 'approver' association is required for an approved post
    p.association :approver, :factory =&gt; :user
  end
</pre>
<h2>Sequences</h2>
<p>
Unique values in a specific format (for example, e-mail addresses) can be
generated using sequences. Sequences are defined by calling <a
href="../classes/Factory.html#M000015">Factory.sequence</a>, and values in
a sequence are generated by calling <a
href="../classes/Factory.html#M000035">Factory.next</a>:
</p>
<pre>
  # Defines a new sequence
  Factory.sequence :email do |n|
    &quot;person#{n}@example.com&quot;
  end

  Factory.next :email
  # =&gt; &quot;person1@example.com&quot;

  Factory.next :email
  # =&gt; &quot;person2@example.com&quot;
</pre>
<p>
Sequences can be used in lazy attributes:
</p>
<pre>
  Factory.define :user do |f|
    f.email { Factory.next(:email) }
  end
</pre>
<p>
And it&#8217;s also possible to define an in-line sequence that is only
used in a particular factory:
</p>
<pre>
  Factory.define :user do |f|
    f.sequence(:email) {|n| &quot;person#{n}@example.com&quot; }
  end
</pre>
<h2>Alternate Syntaxes</h2>
<p>
Users&#8217; tastes for syntax vary dramatically, but most users are
looking for a common feature set. Because of this, factory_girl supports
&#8220;syntax layers&#8221; which provide alternate interfaces. See <a
href="../classes/Factory/Syntax.html">Factory::Syntax</a> for information
about the various layers available.
